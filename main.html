        <h3> Here are some cool highlights of Naruto:</h3>
        <p>Naruto is a series of many highlights, most of my favourites being the fights (but I have included other things):</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><em>"Your words cut deeper than any blade"</em>:</strong>
            <p>
              In the very first arc of the series we encounter a very peak moment which sets the tone for the rest of 
              the series. I was debating whether or not to inlcude this as I don't want to spoil the series, but this is what got me hooked to this great story.
              You can watch the scene on YouTube <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Lee vs Gaara:</strong>
            <p>
              This is the fight everyone points towards when describing the peak fights of this series, and they do so for good reason.
              Although it's not my personal favourite it is still in my top 5 fights and is honestly a treat to watch. You can watch it on Youtube <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Naruto vs Sasuke - First Fight:</strong>
            <p>
              This was the first of many iconic showdowns between the 2 protagonists of the series. Lots of emotion, quality animation
              and a perfect ending fight to pre-time-skip Naruto. You can watch it on Youtube using this <a href="" target="_blank">link</a>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Naruto vs Pain:</strong>
            <p>
              This fight is pretty deep into Naruto Shippuden and I think the pain arc is the best arc of the series. This fight is where Naruto get's
              his getback against Pain and is what makes this fight so cathartic. This fight challenges Naruto on 2 fronts, strength and values. He has to beat pain both
              physically and mentally via convincing him that he is not right about the world. I don't want to spoil the stroy so I'll leave it at that, but if you want to watch the
              fight here's the <a href="" target="">link</a> to the YouTube vid.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Gaara's War Speech:</strong>
            <p>
              One thing that I think doesn't get enough credit in this series is the absolute bars some of these characters spit. There are so many iconic speeches to choose from 
              the series, but I decided between either Madaras speech to a certain someone ("Wake up to reality") and gaaras speech. I chose gaaras speech becasue it hits my soul 
              and sounds really raw, especially in the dub where Liam O'Brian (I think that's his name) crushes the speech. Although it would spoil the series you can watch 
              the speech using this Youtube <a href="" target="_blank">link</a>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Madara's Entry:</strong>
            <p>
              Just watch it. It's supreme peak. However it is a major spoiler to those who haven't seen the series. Here's the <a href="">link</a>. But watch it knowing that it will
              spoil the series if you connect the dots early on.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Naruto vs Sasuke - Final Fight:</strong>
            <p>
              This fight is my personal favourite of the series, the animation, story-telling(yes fights can also tell stories) and emotions work so well. People also dislike the 
              shonen trope of a story's power creep, wherefights devolve into beam clashes etc. but this fight mixed the crazy op techniques with crisp hand-to-hand combat which
              this series excels in. Again watching this will spoil a lot of things but it is just too good of a highlight to miss out. You can watch it using 
              this <a href="" target="_blank">link</a>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>The Naruto Storm Games:</strong>
            <p>
              The Ultimate Ninja Storm Series (1-4) is one of the best series of anime games ever. It is a pretty good way of experiencing the series if you don't want to watch 
              or read the story, with unique fight scenes taking place exclusively in the game which is an added bonus. Absolute Cinema!
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I hope those highlights were enjoyable, now let me explain why I think naruto is one of the most formative pieces of media in history. I remember first watching this 
          series thinking it to be like any other cartoon but slowly finding out that things were a lot deeper than most cartoons the characters and the world they were in
          had a variation of values that were always clashing and the central theme of peace was always being explored in some way. Be it the show of strength in the chunin exams
          or characters staright up taking about trying to attain peace, it is a very poetic theme especially in this day and age where people can't keep any peace. The story 
          resonates with me and many others and has reached millions and I think this is one of the central reasons as to why this series is so influential in current history.
