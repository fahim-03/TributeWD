Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks. Do not copy this demo project.

User Stories:
    Done - Your tribute page should have a main element with a corresponding id of main, which contains all other elements
    Done -You should see an element with an id of title, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")
    Done -You should see either a figure or a div element with an id of img-div
    Done -Within the #img-div element, you should see an img element with a corresponding id="image"

    Turn these to Done after done:
        Your #image should use max-width and height properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size
        Your img element should be centered within its parent element
